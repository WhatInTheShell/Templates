1. Scope

This DR plan applies to all syslog-ng servers within the organization's infrastructure. It ensures:

Logs are stored securely.

Log processing resumes quickly post-disaster.

Compliance with regulatory and operational requirements.



---

2. Roles and Responsibilities


---

3. Pre-Disaster Preparation

3.1 Infrastructure

Maintain redundant servers across multiple geographic locations.

Use load balancers to distribute log traffic.

Deploy high-availability clusters for syslog-ng servers.


3.2 Backups

Configure daily backups for:

Configuration files (/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf)

Certificates and encryption keys.

Log data.


Store backups on both on-premises and cloud-based storage.


3.3 Documentation

Maintain:

Inventory of servers (IP, hostname, OS version).

Access credentials in a secure location (e.g., password manager).

Network diagrams showing syslog-ng data flow.



3.4 Testing

Conduct bi-annual DR drills to validate recovery procedures.

4. Disaster Identification

4.1 Types of Disasters

Hardware Failure: Disk or server failure.

Network Issues: Disrupted connectivity.

Software Issues: Corrupted syslog-ng configurations.

Security Incident: Compromised system integrity.

Natural Disaster: Fire, flood, or other events impacting data centers.


4.2 Disaster Severity Levels

Minor: Single server affected, no data loss.

Major: Multiple servers affected, partial data loss.

Critical: Complete logging infrastructure down, significant data loss.

5. Recovery Procedures

5.1 Minor Disasters

1. Identify the affected server using monitoring tools (e.g., Nagios, Zabbix).


2. Restart syslog-ng services:

sudo systemctl restart syslog-ng


3. Verify service status:

sudo systemctl status syslog-ng


4. Restore configuration files if needed:

cp /backup/path/syslog-ng.conf /etc/syslog-ng/
sudo systemctl restart syslog-ng


5. Check log ingestion and forwarding.



5.2 Major Disasters

1. Switch traffic to redundant servers via load balancers.


2. Restore the latest backups:

Retrieve configuration files and logs from backup storage.

Restore files:

cp /backup/path/* /etc/syslog-ng/
cp /backup/logs/* /var/log/syslog-ng/



3. Rebuild server if necessary:

Install syslog-ng:

sudo apt update && sudo apt install syslog-ng

Apply configuration files and certificates.



4. Validate server functionality.



5.3 Critical Disasters

1. Activate DR Site:

Redirect traffic to DR site servers.



2. Restore full infrastructure:

Provision new servers if required.

Restore all backups.

Update DNS and network routing to DR site.



3. Perform integrity checks:

Validate data completeness.

Check for anomalies or signs of compromise.



4. Notify stakeholders and coordinate a return-to-normal plan.




---

6. Post-Recovery Validation

1. Verify syslog-ng service health:

sudo systemctl status syslog-ng


2. Validate log ingestion and forwarding:

Check logs arriving at SIEM or log management system.

Test sending a log message:

logger "Test message"



3. Ensure monitoring and alerting systems are operational.


4. Document recovery efforts and lessons learned.

7.1 Common Commands

7.2 Backup Validation Checklist

Are backups recent and complete?

Do they include configuration files and logs?
